# Introduction
It's the original backend to apnscp, built in Tcl back in 2003, maybe up to 2004. It exists for historical reasons 
and acted as a broker between Ensim and Apis Networks' panel, because Ensim had several bugs that could not be resolved
at the time due to proprietary code and a limited release schedule. None of the code present is functonal, but serves as
a concept between what apnscp was and what it became.

If I can uncover some more of the original base, it will be posted as it becomes available.
