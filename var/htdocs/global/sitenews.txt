10/6/04: ACLs have been fully deployed now and as a &quot;site administrator&quot;, you now have the ability to access other users' files, delete other users' files, and modify other users' files -- including
those owned by user apache (created from Gallery, for example).  This means to manage a subdomain, you no longer need to login as
that user, but rather you can login with your normal account name of <?php echo $gUserName; ?><br /><br />
10/8/04: Only the default behavior for the ACL was applied to directories on 
10/6, preventing proper access by the site administrator.  If the directory of
another user were chmod'd to 700, the site administrator would have been 
unable to access the directory.  Conversely, any new directory created though
would have been fully accessible.  A second round of the ACL permissions was 
made today to patch up that last loose end and everything should be fine.<br /><br />
9/19/04: After falling back to MySQL 4.0.19 due to stability problems with
4.0.20, MySQL 4.0.19's Unix socket (what the client connects through when
using 'localhost' as the host) vanished.   The problem, which only affected
those who used 'localhost' as the host name (40% quicker approximately,
continue to use that whenever possible), lasted from about 5 AM EST until 1:30
PM EST.  This was the initial problem, that occurred once a week on Sunday morning, which prompted the upgrade to 4.0.20.
Fortunately, now 4.0.21 is out and currently running on the server.  So far,
connections look stable -- no timeouts during communication packet reads have
been logged in the past 30 minutes -- and by next Sunday, there should not be
an outage during log rotation.<br /><br />
9/20/04 at approximately 5:32 PM - 5:35 PM: Vector and surrounding servers
experienced a momentary outage when the main power relay for this set of
servers was accidentally disconnected.<br /><br />
9/22/04: Reboot tonight at midnight for a kernel upgrade.  Downtime should be
less than 5 minutes.  Correction, make that at 8:20 PM EST.  After a socket
error with Apache upon reload, the server was forcefully restarted.
Fortunately the updated kernel patches a few socket issues and increases performance.
<br /><br />
9/24/04: At approximately 11:10 AM the power strip on which this server is
hosted was swapped out in favor of one permitting remote reboot capabilities:
<br />
&quot;On Friday, September 24th, servers at DC2 will be migrated to remote
reboot-enabled power strips. Once this work is completed, you will be able to
power cycle your servers through a web-based interface - in real time, without
contacting tech support. This will offer you greater convenience and more
control, and allow our team to better focus on serving you.
<br /><br />
The migration is scheduled to take place between 0700 and 1900 CST. Part of
the process will involve removing and replacing your power cable. We highly
recommend that you perform full backups of your system prior to this
maintenance window. The estimated downtime for each server will be no more
than 20 minutes. Our technicians will verify that migrated servers are powered
up properly and continue to function smoothly.&quot;<br /><br />
10/2/04: There will be a kernel upgrade scheduled on Sunday night at midnight
EST to make way for ACLs.  Downtime should be no longer than five minutes and
will allow for root-like access to users files as the site administrator.<br
/><br />
10/13/04: After speaking to the largest customer regarding migrating servers,
he agreed.  The site in question has been migrated over to a more empty server
and MySQL connection errors should subside, along with load average problems
as of 2:49 AM EST.
<br /><br />
10/19/04: The big structural changes to the servers has been announced.  For
further information, please <a href="http://apisnetworks.com/changes.php"

<br />
<br />
12/11/04: As a precautionary measure for future instances whenever the a
socket is "stuck" on the server (fails to unbind when the server is reloaded),
the monitoring script will be modified to check for socket errors and reboot
accordingly.  Last night the server was down from approximately 7 AM until
noon EST (-5 GMT) due to the error, which happens seldomly.
